Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1) **Nilesh** did the roll call. </br> </br> 2) **Nilesh** provided the status of ATO. </br> </br> He mentioned that eMASS transition has affected the RMS review to be done by Bobbi's team. </br> </br>  3) **David** provided a more detailed update on the ATO. </br> </br> He mentioned that the team met with SO, VA PM, and ISO to pursue a FastTrack ATO approval by seeking a 1-year conditional ATO.  </br> </br>  He mentioned that all three of them agreed that VAM should pursue a 1-year conditional ATO given the eMASS impact on the project. </br> </br> David further mentioned that by seeking a one-year conditional ATO, VAM may still get a 3-year or even full ATO based on the AO's (Authorizing Official) review of the ATO package. </br> </br> David reiterated that the approach to pursue 1-year conditional ATO will advance the ATO process for VAM faster than the new longer and lengthier process of approval in eMASS. </br> </br> 4) **Dr. Richards** commented that the AbleVets team did all its work in preparing the ATO Package in RV.  </br> </br> He acknowledged that all the ATO documents including all the POAM's were created, and all signatures were acquired, and all controls were updated in RV.  </br> </br> He mentioned AbleVets was about the submit the ATO package for approval but the eMASS transition has created some unexpected speed bumps that need to be overcome with the submission of 1-year ATO package. </br> </br> 5) **Dr. Richards** requested to create a eMASS migration dashboard in GitHub as a new repository </br> </br> 6) **Conor** provided a technical update on their analysis of the MUMPS code for version D5. |
