What was accomplished in the prior week </br> iii. What is planned for the coming week </br>  iv.	Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1.  Meeting Cancelled due to unavailability of multiple team members.  However, the meeting notes have been updated to provide status in lieu of the meeting. </br> </br>  2.  We have submitted everything that is required in eMASS pending official guidance on controls, POAMs, and Categorization of VAM. </br> </br> 3.  We have provided all the necessary information and evidence to satisfy the eMASS requirements regarding the controls in VAM’s eMASS instance unless VA guidance proves otherwise. </br> </br> 4.  We are ready to submit the ATO Package to be reviewed by Bobbi and the eMASS Case Manager, pending these following VA/eMASS requirements: </br> <ul> <li> Official POAM guidance on POAM creation, review, and implementation. </li>  <li>Privacy controls pending PIA Support completion and/or guidance. </li>  <li> ISSO and Case Manager review and possible approval of VAM’s eMASS specific Categorization. </li>  <li> As per Joseph Fourcade, ASOB will not be ready to review ATO packages until late September or Early October. According to him submitting an ATO package at any time prior won't affect approval timeline. </li>  <li> Also, Joseph Fourcade has said that the IOC Board will not be ready  to review, as a result of the current eMASS requirements.  The IOC Board will be TBD sometime later in October. </li> </ul> 5.  Bobbi said that the entire review process not counting the AOSB review is contingent upon entire guidance on the RMF process fully being completed. </br> </br> 6.  Which includes, those reviewing VAM eMASS package (not counting AOSB) have been trained in the eMASS RMF review process. <ul> <li> However, the VA review team is still learning the eMASS RMF Process.  </li> <li> Sometimes it is trial and error until all the kinks are worked out.  For example, the POAM and inheritance categorization has changed 3 times since migration. </li> </ul> 7.  Once an item has been submitted by AbleVets team in eMASS, it is in the hands of who ever is reviewing any one specific process step (ranging from categorization, controls, or POAMs) to complete their review and provide guidance if need be. </br> </br> 8.  Bobbi highlighted the fact that the RMF review process is staggered by eMASS Roles. <ul> <li> So if one reviewer isn’t done with his/her review, next reviewer cannot expedite the process until they have the access to complete their review. </li> </ul> 9.  Bobbi also said that the VA now requires naming conventions for PreProd and Prod instances instead of IP addresses. </br> </br> 10.  Bobbi once again highlighted that the VA Program Manager/COMS must manage the IT requirements for this project instead of contractors. </br> </br> 11.  As per Bobbi, eMASS ATO Package review cannot be expedited to AOSB prior to them being ready for eMASS review unless it is an emergency. </br> </br> 12.  Bobbi suggested that distribute the eMASS RMF review process timeline with the VAM team.
