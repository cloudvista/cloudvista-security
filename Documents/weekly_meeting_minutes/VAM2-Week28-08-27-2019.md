Meeting Cancelled due to unavailability of multiple team members.  However, the meeting notes have been updated to provide status in lieu of the meeting. </br> </br>  2.  Update from ATO eMASS Migration: <ul> <li> Joseph Fourcade suggested that we categorize VAM’s inheritance as VAEC in eMASS. However, we recently categorized VAM’s inheritance correctly in eMASS as VAEC. </li> <li> Joseph’s suggestion to remove our current categorization would impact our current progress unnecessarily and increase the amount of controls we would have to do significantly. </li> <li> Joseph was not wrong, but he did not know that we currently had the correct categorization.  >/li> <li> Eight new control families (As a result of eMASS's privacy requirements) have been submitted to the Privacy office, because these controls will be assessed and completed by them, per VA guidance for systems with types of inheritance such as VAM. </li> <li> These controls account for 183 assessment control procedures, most of which have already been inherited. </li> <li> The remaining non-compliant privacy controls will be addressed by the Privacy office. </li> <li> Once they have completed and sent back, we will import into eMASS. </li> </ul> |
