Meeting Cancelled due to unavailability of multiple team members.  However, the meeting notes have been updated to provide status in lieu of the meeting. </br> </br>  2.  Update from ATO eMASS Migration: <ul> <li> The ATO Team was inadvertently kicked out of eMASS the day after reobtaining eMASS access. </li> <li> To regain access required SO approval. However, SO was out for a week.  Thus, we had no access from Friday, 08-09-2019 to Friday, 08-16-2019.  >/li> <li> We still had the exported Controls Spreadsheet from eMASS to work offline during this interim period. </li> <li> Starting today, 08-20-2019, ATO team received new eMASS inheritance guidelines from ISSO, which was later discovered that the current VAM eMASS inheritance classification has been rendered incorrect. </le> <li>  However, the new guidelines was also inaccurate in relation to what VAM is. </li> <li>  All of this considered, prompted ATO team to perform extensive research to determine accurate inheritance classification. </li> <li> Also, However, eMASS currently does not have a category for classifying a PaaS's level of inheritance in eMASS. </li> <li> So the ATO Team is now discussing with the VA's COMS Team to determine the correct inheritance classification. </li> <li> Once this is done, we will have an accurate count of the Control Assessment Procedures. </li>  </ul> | 
| 4. |	Next Steps | Update eMASS classification for ATO package. Update eMASS Migration Dashboard in GitHub. Here is the Link to the updated RiskVision to eMASS Migration Dashboard. https://github.com/vistadataproject/VAM2ProjectManagement/blob/master/eMASS_Transition/README.md|
