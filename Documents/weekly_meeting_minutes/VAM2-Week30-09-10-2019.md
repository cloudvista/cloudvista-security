| 2. | Introductions |  | 
| 3. | Key Points </br>  1. high level summaries will be presented for:  </br>  a. Management  </br>  b. Technical  </br> </br> 2. Agenda for each track:  </br>  i. Overview of progress  </br> ii. What was accomplished in the prior week </br> iii. What is planned for the coming week </br>  iv.	Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1.  Meeting Cancelled due to unavailability of multiple team members. However, the meeting notes have been updated to provide status in lieu of the meeting. </br> </br> 2.  We had the call with the PIA support contact to provide us guidance on the remaining privacy controls. </br> </br> 3.  All controls have been addressed. We just need to wait for PIA to complete their controls matrix (About a week or less), which is essentially the evidence we need to justify VAM privacy controls inheritance. </br> </br> 4.	Once we upload the matrix, all controls in eMASS will have been completed. </br> </br> 5.	The only items left to add to the controls will be POAMS, uploading the DRP/CP training as evidence, adding the proper naming conventions to the Hardware/Software and reuploading. </br> </br> 6.  From the meeting early today, it was mentioned that the SA is tentative, pending new VA guidance, which relates with the SSP. Both eMASS related, thus another VA related delay </br> </br> 7.  We also have another way to finally get the EDS scan. With our new COMs representative, they should assist. We’ve already reached out. Again, this is a likely N/A scan, but we could use the receipt of N/A as evidence. Moreover, and related, we submitted our systems IP back to SCCD to identify our system. For some reason, our system wasn’t showing up in the ISRM distro (we have evidence it once did and it was confirmed). Nevertheless, with the new IPs, this had to be redone anyway. |
