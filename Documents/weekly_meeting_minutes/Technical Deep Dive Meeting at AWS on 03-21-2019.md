VAM2 Technical Deep Dive | **Dr. Richards:** 1) Explained the purpose of the meeting is to get the VAM2 team technically updated on the AWS track. </br> 2) He also revealed that the Omaha and Valley Coastal, Texas VistA have been identified as the VAM2 IOC VistAs. </br> 3) He mentioned that the Texas and Omaha VistA will be available by June 22nd for VAM2 use. </br> 4) Internal VA MOUs to migrate to AWS for these two VistAs are done. </br> 5) They will be production deployable copies as per the MOU. </br> </br> **Connor:** 1) Updated the group on the technical necessity of the VAM2. </br> 2) Traffic coming into all of the VistA’s from over 400,000 windows users.  </br> 3) Currently there is no monitoring or log in the VistA. </br> 4) VAM2 is meant to be Data-Driven, minimally-invasive intelligent auditing and alerting classifier system of RPC inquires in to the VistA. </br> 5) He covered the various options available technically to deliver VAM2. </br> 6) In particular he talked using about physical Router(s) vs. software shield to ensure only the recognized RPC’s are allowed in the VistA. </br> </br> **Mike Furoyama:** Presented the new architecture. He mentioned the slight architectural shift that aims the project in a better direction. He said the change helps in Safety and Scaling of the system. https://github.com/vistadataproject/RPCMirror  </br> </br> **Tom:** Explained the VA processes and procedures that need to be followed and or adhered to in delivering the VAM2 project. </br> </br> During the course of the discussions, AWS team highlighted that their product Dynamo which is expected to be available later this year will suit the needs of VAM2 far better than the AWS Kinesis that has currently been suggested in the meeting  as a key part of the VAM2 solution.</br>  </br> **Dr. Richards** acknowledged the probable capacity of Dynamo but stated that we will continue with Kinesis for the current VAM2 project as Dynamo is still not available and we can’t base our solution based on a not-yet-available software. </br> </br> **Nilesh:** highlighted that the AbleVets team is doing the project management and how the current timelines and lead times required for permissions etc. are managed. |
