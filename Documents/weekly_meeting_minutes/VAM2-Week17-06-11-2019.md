Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1) **Nilesh** did the roll call. </br> </br> **Cheryl** is in training until June 13th. </br> </br> 2) **Dr. Richards** asked for the status of the ATO package documents' signatures. </br> **Bobbi** mentioned she will sign the documents once the SO has approved them and signed them. </br> </br> **Tom** explained that the SO will perform his final review once the scan screenshots are incorporated in the documents.  </br> </br> 3)  **Dr. Richards** indicated that the SO should sign the documents now; the architecture of VAM will not change from environment to environment, and the RPC Mirror and RPC Monitor Code will not change either. The only possible changes will be to the ports and their mappings.  </br> </br> 4) **Bobbi** mentioned that there will be a difference in the architecture.  **Tom** explained that while it is true that the code that is being built by the Development team will be stable, in the AWS environment, the entire PreProduction instance will be built in a way that mimics the Production environment.  In order to do so, his team is creating a VPC in the cloud that has EC2 Redhat Linux servers in the OIS layer.  The Kubernetes that sit on top of the EC2 are the Runtime Orchestration layer, and the RPC Mirror and Monitor will be the pods on top of Kubernetes. This environment is auto-scalable horizontally and vertically, using the autoscaling group. The EC2 load balancer directs the traffic appropriately, as per the predetermined thresholds. IBM BigFix and Splunk are deployed in this environment. </br> </br>  5) **Conor** mentioned that there is no customization of the AWS consoles, and there is no GUI for VAM.  </br> **Tom** mentioned that we still need to build the environments so that the proper scans are provided by the CSOC for the ATO. Further, the autoscaling that his team is building has CubeControl. </br>  </br> 6) **Conor** mentioned that Build 4 was delivered on June 7, 2019 |
