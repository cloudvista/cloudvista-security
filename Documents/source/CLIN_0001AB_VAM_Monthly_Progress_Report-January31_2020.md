# <a id="introduction"></a>1. Introduction

The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Adaptive Maintenance (VAM) System is a cloud-native Platform as a Service (PaaS), deployed entirely and exclusively within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC), leveraging the Amazon Web Services (AWS) commercial cloud infrastructure and services.

VAM provides comprehensive, commercial cloud-based monitoring and security for all clients, applications, and users of the VistA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface. VAM is operationalized and scaled for Enterprise Production use for all VistA systems migrated to the VAEC, leveraging FedRAMP High, VAEC-approved AWS Kinesis and AWS CloudWatch Logs.

VAM is a passive monitoring PaaS that mirrors VistA RPC traffic via AWS Kinesis to the AWS CloudWatch Logs, which is then interpreted by the RPC Monitor. AWS CloudWatch Logs are FedRAMP High certified and store all data in an encrypted form.

VAM is a 100% cloud-native, legacy-free, and non-invasive PaaS. VAM requires no change to any VistA system, nor to any end user client or application, allowing VAM to be safely and reliably deployed and scaled Enterprise-wide with minimal to no risk. Should VAM (RPC Mirror or Monitor) be disabled or deactivated, all RPC traffic flows between VistA and all its clients as usual, only without monitoring.

All of VAM's functionality is contained exclusively and entirely as a PaaS within the VAEC, thus inheriting all security and compliance controls of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) High VAEC. VAM has neither a connection to, nor does it share any information with, any organization, application, or system outside of the VAEC.
