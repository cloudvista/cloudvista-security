# 1. Purpose
To obtain and maintain a VA Authority-to-Operate (ATO), the authorization requirements included within the contents of this document must be completed.  RiskVision, VA's's Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) tool is the authoritative management tool for the VA Assessment and Authorization (A&A) process and Risk Management Framework.  All systems will be assessed in RiskVision by an OIS representative [Certification Agent (CA)] for an authorization recommendation to be submitted to the OIS Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) [Authorizing Official] for final ATO consideration.  

RiskVision guidance documentation can be found on the Office of Information Security (OIS) Portal.  The Assessment & Authorization Requirements section of this document outlines the technical/testing and security documentation requirements necessary to support an authorization decision.  In addition to the descriptions and procedures in this document, the authorization requirements are listed in the Authorization Requirements Quick Link Reference Guide located on the OIS Portal and in Appendix A of this document.

This is a living document based on current federal and VA security policies, standards and guidance, and is subject to change.

# 2. Scope
These procedures apply to systems that are required to obtain an Authority to Operate (ATO). It does not apply to sandbox environments, non-VA networks, or development networks not otherwise connected to the VA network. Those environments will be excluded from the procedures identified in this SOP. They will not be entered into GRC and thus any documentation to include POAMs would not be loaded into GRC and GRC would not be the appropriate tracking mechanisms for deficiencies. 

# 3. Authorization Prerequisites
The following steps need to be followed once a system is identified as needing a VA authorization decision:

1. __Designate an ISO to the project.__  If an ISO is not yet assigned, complete the following steps:

   (a) System Owner or delegate completes the Request For Information Security Officer Support Form and e-mail to VAFSSISORequests@va.gov.
   (b) The FSS ISO work group will coordinate an ISO assignment to help the project team assist with authorization requirements and participate with information security requirements throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

2. __Create a RiskVision entry of the Application or System__ by completing the following steps:

   (a) System Owner or delegate completes the RV System Inventory Checklist. Reach out to the ISO or the RiskVision Working Group (RVWG) VARiskVisionWG@va.gov with any questions regarding checklist completion.
   (b) The RVWG will include the Application/System for discussion on the weekly meeting agenda, scheduled Thursdays at 12:00pm EST.  During the meeting, RVWG can approve or deny the Application/System or request additional information before a decision. 
   (c) Once RVWG approves the Application/System for a RiskVision entry, the System Owner or delegate will be notified by OIS via e-mail from the GRC Service Desk (vaGRCservicedesk@va.gov) stating access to the applicable instance of RiskVision: 
     * National Release GRC Instance: https://vaww.grc.va.gov/spc/index.jsp 
     * Enterprise Operations GRC Instance: https://vaww.eogrc.va.gov/spc/index.jsp

3. Once the applicable parties have access to RiskVision and the system resides in the tool, __the System Owner or delegate shall contact their ISO to review the authorization requirements and determine if certain requirements are not applicable__ based on the type of system in question.

The applicable system POCs must have their authorization package completed, uploaded to RiskVision, and progressed to *__CA Provide Certification Recommendation__* in the workflow no less than 45 calendar days prior to the date they want their authorization decision to be made.  

# 4. Assessment & Authorization (A&A) Requirements
The VA A&A requirements include technical/testing, security documentation, and security control compliance requirements. Details about the various requirements are in the following sections. Authorization packages must be completed, uploaded to RiskVision, and progressed to ÒCA Provide Certification RecommendationÓ in the workflow no less than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the ATO decision consideration deadline. If a required security control is not implemented, the project team must create a POA&M/Finding in RiskVision to keep track of the remediation effort. 

Note: Only completed, required A&A security artifacts including the technical scan results and remediation strategies should be uploaded to Documents tab within RiskVision. Documents tab is not the place to upload evidence.    

All systems currently in the GRC tool that are moving to the VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) environment MUST go to the RVWG and a new entry be made to create the new ATO package.

If a system undergoes a significant (major) change (as defined below) after an ATO determination is made, it is required to re-complete the A&A requirements, including updating all security documentation to reflect the change. Additionally, the Major Change Notification Form, which can be found here, must be completed and included with the Authorization package that must be uploaded to RiskVision, and progressed to ÒCA Provide Certification RecommendationÓ in the workflow no less than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the ATO decision consideration deadline.

__Significant Change Definition:__ Per the current draft VA Handbook 6500.3, Assessment, Authorization, And Continuous Monitoring of VA Information Systems, the definition of significant change is as follows: A significant (major) change to an information system or environment of operation is a change that is likely to affect the security state of the information system. Significant changes to an information system may include, but are not limited to, for example: 
(i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application; 
(ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; 
(iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform; 
(iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or 
(v) modifications to security controls. 

Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include, but are not limited to, for example: 
(i) moving to a new facility; 
(ii) adding new core missions or business functions; 
(iii) acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a threat source; or 
(iv) establishing new/modified laws, policies, or regulations.

## 4.3 Technical/Testing Requirements
The following section provides details on each of the technical/testing requirements including a description of the requirements and the parties/OIS organization(s) that will assist in the completion of the requirements.  If a technical/testing requirement is not applicable, then the System Owner/Delegate needs to upload a word document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why the specific technical/testing requirement is not applicable.

The links to CSOC Supplemental Scan Request (Vulnerability and Compliance), CSOC Database Scan Questionnaire, and CSOC Penetration Test & WASA Questionnaire can be found at CSOC Scan Documents. Additionally, the necessary information and step-by-step instruction for developing, maintaining, reporting and monitoring weaknesses as it relates to a specific system can be found in the POA&M Management Guide.

Findings identified in each technical scan should be mitigated within the remediation timeframe specified in the VA Handbook 6500, (i.e.) Critical: 30 days; High: 60 days; Moderate : 90 days; Low : determined by the System Owner; Emergent : ASAP. One finding should be created in RiskVision for each of the applicable scans to track the remediation progress. In addition, well documented remediation strategy with expected remediation date and status of each finding should also be uploaded to Documents tab within RiskVision for each of the applicable scan.   

### 4.3.1 Nessus Scan / [Discovery Scan (part of Nessus scan)]
A credentialed vulnerability scan against all instances of the operating system and desktop configurations must be conducted to identify security flaws. When conducting the Nessus Scan, a discovery scan to identify all assets within the authorization boundary must be conducted as a part of the vulnerability scan (a discovery scan will not enumerate any vulnerabilities). All Critical and High deficiencies should be mitigated with documented mitigation evidence provided, and Moderate and Low deficiencies should be mitigated or have a documented mitigation plan.  This mitigation plan should include a timetable for mitigation of Moderate and Low deficiencies.

If a system's Nessus Scan data is not currently displayed in the Threat & Vulnerability Manager (TVM) within RiskVision, refer to the TVM guidance material located on the OIS portal at Training and Brown Bag Materials site for detailed information on how to access TVM. 

The following steps must be performed to meet the Nessus Scan requirement (if the Nessus Scan data is included in TVM, skip to Step 3):

1. If the system receives a monthly predictive Nessus vulnerability scan from CSOC and the IP addresses that make up the system are all Windows based then please provide the IP Ranges to the ISRM at vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov, so the applicable Nessus data can be provided in TVM within RiskVision, then proceed to Step 3.
a) If the system receives a monthly predictive Nessus vulnerability scan from CSOC, and the IP addresses that make up the system are not all Windows based, then proceed step 2, as all necessary Operating System information will not be captured in the predictive scans from CSOC that are filtered into TVM. 
b) If the IP addresses that make up a system are outside of the VA network (Managed Services) and/or the system does not currently receive a monthly predictive Nessus vulnerability scan from CSOC, then proceed to Step 2.
2. System Owner or delegate can request a Nessus scan using this link. Once the request is completed, ISRM will work with CSOC to determine if a separate supplemental vulnerability scan shall be conducted or authentication information for the non-Windows devices be added to the existing monthly predictive scan. If a separate supplemental scan is decided on by ISRM/CSOC, upload the results to the Documents tab within RiskVision when results are sent to you or if its decided that the authentication information can be added for the non-Windows devices to the monthly predictive scans conducted by CSOC then please provide the IP Ranges to vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov, so the applicable Nessus data can be provided in TVM within RiskVision. 
a) Note:  CSOC must conduct an independent Nessus Scan for all VA owned systems and Managed Services. CSOC has visibility into Enterprise Operations (EO) systems and has the ability to perform Nessus scans in coordination with system personnel if needed. External systems / Managed Services must have a recent CSOC Nessus scan conducted either via remote connection or by utilizing CSOC staff on-site to perform scans, when necessary. 
3. Once the system's Nessus Scan data is accurately shown in TVM within RiskVision, System Owner or delegate follows these steps:
a) Browse to Information Central Analytics and Metrics Platforms (ICAMP) and use the Remediation Effort Entry Form (REEF) to document your manual remediation effort. For each deficiency identified from the scan, the System Owner or delegate creates a response within REEF for mitigating the deficiencies and / or provides evidence that the deficiencies have been mitigated.  Also, include the scheduled completion date and status of each deficiency within REEF.  
b) Once all manual remediation has been documented within REEF, run this report https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/FODW_PVT/Progress%20Reports/Progress_ReportbyRegion_Chart.rdl within ICAMP.
c) Export the report by going to the upper left side of the screen select the Actions Menu. Choose Export and select Excel. Save the file. 
d)  System Owner or delegate then uploads the report from step 3 above to the Documents tab within RiskVision.  Mitigation information can also be provided in the Vulnerabilities tab within RiskVision. 
e) Within the uploaded mitigation strategy, each system should conduct an analysis on the results of the vulnerability scans to determine and document those findings that are false positives, not applicable to the system, or otherwise mitigated. Additionally, findings that must be remediated through or from the vendor should also be documented as part of this analysis.
Note:  If Nessus Scan data is not currently provided in TVM for the system and instead raw Nessus Scan results exist from CSOC, the System Owner or delegate shall upload the actual Nessus Scan results to the Documents tab in RiskVision; along with a mitigation strategy for each finding. Also, within ICAMP, if the ISO/System Owner does not have an option to pull a report for their FISMA reportable system, then contact the VA GRC Service Desk to provide the IP address range of the system authorization boundary to add it to ICAMP to pull the report.    
4. System Owner or delegate creates one finding and a response in the Findings tab within RiskVision for the Nessus scan to serve as a reminder to resolve the deficiencies.

Note: A follow-up Nessus scan may be requested by OIS to ensure deficiencies have been mitigated and new deficiencies do not exist as part of the ongoing authorization process.

Continuous Monitoring Requirement : CSOC conducts predictive Nessus vulnerability scans on a monthly basis.  A supplemental scan is required for A&A purposes when requested by OIS, CSOC, and/or when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported. To maintain the authorization decision, the system must meet this continuous monitoring requirement. 

#### 4.3.1.1 Database Scan 
Both HQ and EO systems must request a database scan if the project hosts a database to store and process information. A database scan must be conducted at least on an annual basis. In order to maintain the authorization decision for the system, any findings must be remediated within the approved timelines for the severity of the findings, and a POA&M must be created in RiskVision to keep track of the remediation effort. Database scans can be requested by visiting this link. The database scanning team can also be reached at VANSOCDBScans@va.gov for more information. If a database scan is not applicable, upload a word document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why a database scan is not applicable.

### 4.3.2 Quality Code Review
Quality code reviews of custom developed VA applications using the approved VA static code analysis tool should be conducted to identify code quality issues within VA application Applications written in languages that are not supported, such as MUMPS, shall be targeted for manual review of testing with other applicable tools; notify the VA Software Assurance (SwA) Program Office if this is the case at: OISSwASupportGroup@va.gov. If a Quality Code Review is not applicable, upload a word document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why a Quality Code Review is not applicable.
For detailed instructions on the code reviews process, reference the VA Quality Code Review SOP and guidance materials, which are posted on the VA SwA Program Office Resource Site. An overview of the quality code review instructions are provided below. 
Verification & Validation (V&V) Quality Code Reviews
V&V quality code reviews are conducted during the development or maintenance of a VA application by the VA Application Development team. Close cooperation between OIS and the Office of Information Technology (OIT), including supporting contractors, is critical to achieving quality code review objectives and increasing the level of confidence that software developed for use at the VA robust and maintainable. The goals of performing quality code reviews includes making sure that unpredictable behavior due to poor code quality is minimized and that V&Vs performed by VA software developers are done correctly and consistently, according to minimum standards prescribed by the VA. 

The following steps must be performed to meet the V&V quality code review requirement:

4.3.4 Penetration Test / Application Assessment
A penetration test or full application assessment (Web Application Security Assessment or Mobile Application Security Assessment) must be performed that includes automated and manual assessment tools and techniques on Internet Facing, Mobile Applications, and/or High Impact Systems. For Internet facing applications, if the application utilizes multiple servers then a WASA and Penetration Test are required, regardless of the FIPS categorization. If the Internet facing application only uses one server then only a WASA is required. All Critical and High deficiencies should be mitigated with documented mitigation evidence provided, and Moderate and Low deficiencies should be mitigated or have a documented mitigation plan. If a Penetration Test / Application Assessment is not applicable, upload a word document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why a Penetration Test / Application Assessment is not applicable.  *The Penetration Test / Application Assessment requirement is not applicable to VistA systems.

The following steps must be performed to meet the Penetration Test/Application Assessment requirement: 

1. System Owner or delegate can request a penetration test/application assessment by completing the CSOC Penetration Test Questionnaire / CSOC WASA Questionnaire / CSOC MASA Questionnaire found at CSOC Scan Documents to request penetration test/application assessment from CSOC. Please allow 30 days for CSOC to schedule/conduct the penetration test/application assessment. 
a) CSOC must conduct an independent penetration test/application assessment for all VA owned applications and Managed Services. CSOC must have visibility into all VA applications where an authorization decision is required. External systems must also have a recent CSOC penetration test/application assessment performed either remotely or by utilizing CSOC staff on-site to perform scans, when necessary. 
2. CSOC will provide results to system POCs.
3. System Owner or delegate uploads actual results to the Documents tab in RiskVision.
4. For each deficiency identified from the penetration test/application assessment, the System Owner or delegate creates a response for mitigating the deficiencies and/or provides evidence that the deficiencies have been mitigated.

Information should be provided in Excel or Word format; refer to the OIS preferred template located on the OIS Portal at A&A Home Documents. System Owner or delegate uploads the aforementioned document to the Documents tab in RiskVision.
a) Within the uploaded mitigation strategy, each system should conduct an analysis on the results of the penetration test to determine and document those findings that are false positives, not applicable to the system, or otherwise mitigated. Additionally, findings that must be remediated through or from the vendor should also be documented as part of this analysis and should be documented in either the report of findings provided from VA-CSOC or as a separate document.
5. System Owner or delegate creates one finding and a response in the Findings tab within RiskVision for the Penetration Test/Application Assessment to serve as a reminder to resolve the deficiencies.

Continuous Monitoring Requirement : A CSOC penetration test/application assessment is required on an annual basis to maintain an ATO and/or when a major change to the system or upgrades to the tools used occurs.  In addition, OI&T conducts penetration testing quarterly on one-fourth of the total number of VA High Systems and/or internet facing systems.

### 4.3.5 Security Configuration Compliance Data
All accreditation boundaries that contain an operating system are required to provide Security Configuration Compliance Data. For EO systems, authorization assessments for application entities are for the application only whereas infrastructure (hardware) is authorized in the appropriate Service Line authorization assessment. Therefore, the requirement for Security Configuration Compliance Data within EO is for the Service Lines only. If Security Configuration Compliance Data is not applicable, upload a word document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why Security Configuration Compliance Data is not applicable. The Security Configuration Compliance Data requires a 90% compliance for a full ATO.
The following steps must be performed to meet the Security Configuration Compliance requirement:

1. The System Owner or delegate contacts ISRM at vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov to ensure the IP addresses or system names that make up their system(s) are appropriately tagged or accounted for in RiskVision. The ISRM office will assist the System Owner with items ÔaÕ and/or ÔbÕ below depending on the system.
a) For systems with IP address ranges internal to the VA that have the IBM BigFix agent installed:
i. System Owner/Delegate should verify their IP addresses or system names by reviewing the boundaries displayed in the Enterprise Visibility and Vulnerability Management (EVVM) Dashboard. 
Regional GSS boundaries can be found at: https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/290/
Facility GSS and System boundaries can be found at: https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/291/

When running the compliance reports please select the applicable information system (Note: Both boundary data and compliance data are updated nightly).  

b) For systems with IP address ranges external to the VA or for systems without the IBM BigFix agent installed yet: The IBM BigFix agent must be installed to receive SCCD. For systems that used to have CSOC provide SCCD, IBM BigFix is outside the scope of the CSOC vulnerability scanning team and CSOC no longer provides SCCD. The System Owner or delegate must ensure the following steps are completed in order to obtain SCCD from IBM BigFix.
i. The system must be defined in RiskVision.
ii. The IP addresses/IP address range of all hosts (servers/workstations) that make up the system must be captured in RiskVision. The System Owner or delegate contacts ISRM at vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov to ensure the IP addresses or system names that make up their system(s) are appropriately tagged or accounted for in RiskVision.
iii. The hosts must have the IBM BigFix agent installed. If the system owner or delegate has issues installing the IBM BigFix agent, then a ticket can be opened with the OIS EV Support team (OISEVSupportGroup@va.gov) to get it installed and functioning properly. Details of the system (FISMA boundary name/hostnames/IP addresses/system admin contact information) need to be included with the ticket request. 
2. System Owner or Delegate uploads the Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports to the Documents tab in RiskVision. The Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports can be found at https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/28U/ and https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/28T/, respectively.   
3. System Owner or Delegate creates one finding/POA&M and a response in the Findings tab within RiskVision for the SCCD to serve as a reminder to resolve the deficiencies.
4. System Owner or Delegate continues to remediate deficiencies identified from the Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports. 
5. System Owner or Delegate uploads new Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports to Documents tab within RiskVision as evidence to show the remediation progress.

Continuous Monitoring Requirement : Security Configuration Compliance Data must be pulled in accordance with the guidance above on a quarterly basis, or when changes are made to the approved secure configuration/hardening guides, or when requested by OIS.


### 4.3.6 Security Control Assessment (SCA)
A SCA may be required by the OIS.  If an SCA is required, all Critical and High POA&Ms should be mitigated with documented mitigation evidence provided. Moderate and Low POA&Ms should be mitigated or have a documented mitigation plan.

The following steps must be performed to meet the SCA requirement:

1. Once notified by OIS that a SCA is required, the appropriate audit team will be notified by the OIS to schedule the assessment.
2. The assigned audit team will conduct the SCA.
3. OIS will create a SCA program for the appropriate entity in GRC that was audited.  
4. The audit team lead will upload the deliverables, to include the SCA report and import the POAMs, within 4 weeks of completion of the audit.  
5. System Owner or delegate creates responses to the POAMs/findings within 15 days of the POAMs uploaded.

Continuous Monitoring Requirement: An SCA will be performed based on the criticality of the system and/or if circumstances arise that require an onsite SCA under the discretion of OIS.

### 4.3.7 Control Implementation Evidence
All control implementation statements evaluated as part of the RiskVision Assessment Workflow need to contain evidence that demonstrates the control was tested, how it was tested, and the results.  The evidence will be required for all controls that are documented to be in place and the results can be documented by going to the appropriate assessment and clicking on the General tab.  From the General tab, select each control in the Control Test column to document how a control was tested, the results, and any associated findings.  

### 4.3.8 Enterprise Discovery Scan
An Enterprise Discovery Scan (EDS) against all instances of the operating system and desktop configurations must be conducted to identify security flaws. Any findings must be remediated within the approved timelines for the severity of the findings, and a POA&M must be created in RiskVision to keep track of the remediation effort. An EDS must be conducted for all internal VA systems, including VAEC based systems. Managed Systems (External systems) are exempt from this requirement.

The following steps must be performed to meet EDS requirements:

1. Browse to the Information Central Analytics and Metrics Platform (ICAMP) and use the EDS input (EDSI) form to document your manual remediation effort. For each deficiency identified from the scan, the System Owner or delegate creates a response within EDSI for mitigating the deficiencies and / or provides evidence that the deficiencies have been mitigated. Also, include the scheduled completion date and status of each deficiency within EDSI.
2. Once all the manual remediation has been documented within EDSI, run this report within ICAMP: https://spsites.cdw.va.gov//sites/FODW_PVT/Progress%20Reports/EDS_ATO_Mitigation.rdl 
3. Export the report by going to the upper left side of the screen select the Actions Menu. Choose Export and select Excel. Save the file. 
4. System Owner or delegate then uploads the report from step c above to the Documents tab within RiskVision. A mitigation plan should also be uploaded to the Documents tab within RiskVision.

Within the uploaded mitigation strategy, each system should conduct an analysis on the results of the EDS to determine and document the findings that are false positives, not applicable to the system, or otherwise mitigated. Additionally, findings that must be remediated through or by the vendor should be documented as part of this analysis.
6. System Owner or delegate creates a POA&M/Finding and a response in the Findings tab within RiskVision for the EDS as outlined by the POA&M Management Guide.

Continuous Monitoring Requirement: CSOC conducts EDS on a quarterly basis. The quarterly results must be pulled in accordance with the guidance above to maintain an ATO. Additionally, the EDS results must be provided when the tool used receives an upgrade, a major change to the system occurs, or when requested by OIS.

## 4.4 Closing
Once all of the above requirements are either met or deemed inappropriate by OIS, the completed package will be submitted to the Authorizing Official by OIS with one of the following recommendations: 

* ATO 
o ATO with Conditions: An authorization decision allowing a system to operate for an established amount of time (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 days) if certain terms and conditions must still be met, or
o Full ATO: An authorization decision allowing a system to operate and fall into the Continuous Monitoring process if all applicable security requirements have been met.
* Denial of ATO (DATO) 
o An authorization decision allowing the authority to halt an existing operational or new system because unacceptable security risks exist.

# Appendix A:  FedRAMP/Cloud VA Requirements 

## FedRAMP Authorized Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Reciprocity (Agency ATO) Process
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is designed to assist agencies in meeting FISMA requirements for cloud systems.  CSPs must meet FedRAMP in order to do business with US government agencies as part of the Cloud first policy.  FedRAMP is designed as a "do once, use many" framework to create efficiency in government procurement of cloud services.  As part of the program, CSPs pursuing FedRAMP are required to be independently assessed by a Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO).  *Per the Acceptance of FEDRAMP Authorization Memo* issued on August 11, 2015 by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Security, existing Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorizations for certified FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider cloud systems should be evaluated, and reused when possible, to reduce the overall time required to grant an authorization and begin using a cloud service.

Note: A contract must be in place before requesting a RiskVision entry of the FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider. In the absence of a contract, RVWG will not entertain any such request.

The Cloud/FedRAMP Reciprocity ATO process consists of the following steps:

1. Designate an ISO and System Owner to the project.
2. Coordinate with the RVWG to request a RiskVision entry of the FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider.  Reference section 2 (Authorization Prerequisites) for action steps.
3. System Owner and ISO will complete the CSP system questionnaire within RiskVision to define the system acronym, security categorization, operational status, system type, cloud computing service model [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), etc.], and cloud service type (private, public, hybrid).
4. ISO will request FedRAMP repository access for CSP authorization documentation package by completing the FedRAMP Agency Access Request Form and emailing to Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) at vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov.
5. ISO will map the CSP authorization documentation artifacts to the VA ATO documentation requirements in RiskVision.  Then review and assess the CSP's 3PAO FedRAMP authorized SSP using the NIST/CAG-20 scoresheet provided by OIS.  All documents will be uploaded to the Documents tab in RiskVision.
6. CSP authorization package in RiskVision will then be advanced to OIS and Certification Authority (CA) for review.  Additionally, VA determines if the CSP system appropriately addresses any and all necessary VA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) requirements (e.g., all external systems, including cloud solutions, hosted from facilities or data centers outside of the VA network and boundary must comply with DHS TIC requirements and VA's external connection agreements) before progressing to the VA CISO and Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) for agency ATO consideration. 


## Cloud-Based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System ATO Process

The Cloud/FedRAMP cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System ATO process consists of the following steps:

1. Coordinate with the RVWG to request a RiskVision entry of the cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System.  Reference section 2 (Authorization Prerequisites) for action steps.
2. System Owner and ISO will complete the CSP/VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System questionnaire within RiskVision to define the system acronym, security categorization, operational status, system type, etc.
3. Customer Responsibilities Security Plan provided by the CSP ISO will be completed by the System Owner.  This set of security controls is documented in the FedRAMP authorized CSP Customer Responsibilities Matrix.  The security plan controls have been mapped to VA 6500 requirements.  
4. ISO will review the completed Customer Responsibilities Security Plan for proper implementation details and uploads to the Documents tab in RiskVision.

The cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System in RiskVision will then be advanced to OIS and Certification Authority (CA) for review before progressing to the VA CISO and Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) for agency ATO consideration.



## Other Federal Agency (Non-FedRAMP) ATO Acceptance

The cybersecurity requirements for VA information systems will be managed through the Risk Management Framework (RMF) consistent with the principals established in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37.  Reciprocal acceptance of other federal agency system authorizations will be implemented to the maximum extent possible.  Refusals must be timely, documented, and reported to the responsible VA Authorizing Official.

VA employees and contract staff working for the VA are prohibited from sending VA data outside the VA Network without an Authority to Operate signed by the VA Authorizing Official.

1. Any project seeking to use another federal agency ATO must contact the vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov to initiate the process.
2. A review of the other agency ATO process will be initiated to ensure it meets VA requirements for NIST 800-53 implementation; ATO package review is allowed; and POAM management and tracking is in place.  In the event the other agency will not share the entire A&A package, negotiations will ensue between VA and the other agency to obtain an agreed upon subset of the required documentation.
3. Once an agreement/understanding is in place to review the other agency package, an entry in RiskVision will be created using the VA 6500.3 Contractor/FedRAMP program.
4. The other Federal Agency ATO memo, along with additional documentation, will be uploaded to the documents tab in RiskVision.  Additional documentation may include a list of open POAMs, required artifacts, Interconnection Security Agreements (ISA)/Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
5. Questionnaires will be answered and any customer responsible controls, if necessary, will be completed and uploaded to the documents tab.
6. The workflow will be progressed to the VA Authorizing Official for review and approval.
o  	If the VA AO refuses reciprocity of the other agency ATO, a memo will be developed and sent to the VA project staff for notification.

# Appendix C: Job Aid: Security Information

Job Aid

Security Information


## 1. Purpose
This Job Aid will assist Information Security Officers (ISOs), Facility Chief Information Officers (FCIOs), System Owners and stakeholders with security responsibilities when performing security-related job functions.  The Job Aid provides security information on the following items:
* Authorization Decision Process 
* VA Authorization Boundaries
* Finding/Milestone Process
* Vulnerability Integration into Authorization Decision Process
* NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 to Rev 4 Transition
This Job Aid is subject to change as new critical security elements emerge and/or VA policies and processes change.

## 2. Authorization Decision Process
Independent third-party Assessment & Authorization (A&A) reviews are conducted to determine the technical security posture of VA's Information Technology (IT) systems. A&A reviews evaluate all applicable system security controls conducted in accordance with the Authorization Requirements Guide / Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  A&A reviews include a combination of: 
* On-site assessments conducted by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) on a sub-set of VA systems and Managed Services.
* Technical security tests (penetration tests, vulnerability scans, discovery scans, and security configuration compliance scans) conducted by the VA-CSOC.
* Verification and Validation (V&V) Secure Code Reviews conducted by VA Application Developers.
* OIS third-party assessments of all system security documentation, on-site assessment results, technical testing results, secure code review results, and configuration files provided by the system personnel.

All VA systems were assessed in August 2013 during the deployment of RiskVision. If a package lacked information but the security posture was acceptable, the Authorizing Official could issue an ATO with Conditions, thereby allowing the system to store, process, or transmit VA data, while the remaining security information is provided by the System Owner.  Under no circumstances, has any VA system been allowed to operate minus a review of the security authorization package required by NIST. It is important to note the NIST affords Federal Departments and Agencies latitude throughout the authorization process to make balanced decisions that are based on security risk and the business needs of the Department. It is incorrect to state that VA systems were not assessed consistent with NIST standards and were allowed to operate devoid of a security posture determination.

VA authorization requirements can be conducted and met using remote capabilities. Therefore, on-site SCAs conducted by ERM are only conducted on a sub-set of VA systems annually.  This is also in part due to lack of resources, funding, and time required to travel to VA and Managed Service sites. The schedule for system SCAs is determined by ERM in coordination with OIS based on available resources, budget, and system SCA needs.

All VA systems are required, and were required upon the issuance of new authorization boundaries, to address the VA Authorization requirements in accordance with the Authorization Requirements SOP / Guide and VA Handbook 6500. 

Reference 1: Authorization Requirements Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) / Guide: A&A Home Documents 

Reference 2: ERM SCA Results are uploaded to RiskVision under the respective system as well as at the following location SCA Assessment Results

Reference 3: DAS Expectation Memo: Authorization Requirements Expectations (March 19, 2014)

## 3. VA Authorization Boundaries
The authorization boundaries were changed in the summer of 2013 to meet OIS strategic goals, improve accountability, better define common controls, and align with actual operational and managerial practices.  The system boundaries for the three major systems cover the entire Region; there are no facility-level boundaries although there are facility-level controls, and RiskVision maps each known IP address to the system that contains it. System security documentation was updated / re-created to reflect the new authorization boundaries in August 2013 and assessed as a part of the OIS third-party assessments.  If the security documentation lacked information but the security posture of the system was acceptable (according to technical testing results, other security artifacts, etc.), the Authorizing Official could issue an ATO with Conditions thereby allowing the system to store, process, or transmit VA data, while the remaining security information was provided by the System Owner. Any SSPs that are incomplete and do not appropriately reflect the authorization boundaries are required to be updated as a condition of the authorization process. In all cases, any gaps in the documentation are thoroughly assessed to determine their impact on the authorization decision.

The system boundaries have been reviewed and approved by the Certification Authority and the Authorizing Official (AO).  The three primary systems / authorization boundaries are as follows:

* VistA - Composed of VistA Mumps environment and its applications, and user data stored in ÔdatÕ files.  This system boundary will not contain IP addresses or operating systems only the Major Application.
* GSS - Composed of desktops, laptops, file/print servers, COTS and other applications including operating systems.  IP addresses are used to define this boundary.
* Infrastructure - Composed of local area networking equipment that connects the other two including, routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, wireless access points. IP addresses are used to define this boundary.

The authorization boundaries are based on NIST 800-18 and summarized in the System Security Plan (SSP) while RiskVision contains a more thorough definition of the boundaries; down to the IP address level. All established IP addresses in VA are assigned to a system boundary and RiskVision contains a list of these IP assignments. Maintaining a current list of IP addresses in the SSP is impractical due to the frequency of IP address changes.   Therefore, the SSP boundary description is a high-level depiction while RiskVision's boundary description includes components down to the device level. 

Note: Facility-level staff are no longer System Owners.  Any questions concerning system boundaries should be referred to the Regional System Owner if facility staff are unable to provide a detailed answer.

## 4. Finding/Milestone Process
RiskVision allows for granular identification and remediation of Findings (aka POA&Ms), accountability, and tracking mechanisms by management. Open Findings are assigned at the entity level to which the control is presented. This means that findings can be presented at a Region entity, GSS Information System, Infrastructure Information System, VistA Information System or facility level.  ISOs are required to conduct reviews of the security control implementation statements and create a Finding in RiskVision, with an associated milestone, for controls that are not properly implemented in accordance with VA and Federal guidance.  January CRISP Focus training and multiple ISO and SDE GRC training opportunities and guidance were provided to assist with the creation of Findings and milestones.

Per the Authorization Requirements SOP and Authorization Requirements training, a Finding should be created by system personnel within RiskVision to track the vulnerabilities identified from scans.  The field is required to develop a remediation plan for the vulnerabilities.

POA&M Transition from SMART to RiskVision
POA&Ms in SMART dated back as early as 2005.  With the implementation of RiskVision, VA is able to capture more relevant information on compliance and security data within IBM BigFix and Nessus.  Also, the new authorization boundaries cause the pre-existing SMART POA&Ms to be irrelevant and outdated; with the exception to the 2012 and 2013 OIG findings which were migrated over to RiskVision. Also, controls that may have been the target during a 2012 facility audit may now only be present at an information system level. With the transformation of the A&A process and its focus on technical security requirements, as opposed to paper based processes (which many of the pre-existing POA&Ms were based on), VA is now able to better articulate the security posture of its information systems. 

Reference 1: CRISP FOCUS SharePoint

Reference 2: Executive Decision Memorandum: FISMA Challenge Recommendations

## 5. Vulnerability Integration into Authorization Decision Process
In accordance with the Authorization Requirements Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) / Guide, OIS assesses vulnerabilities identified through the following tests / scans provided in RiskVision by system personnel prior to T/ATO issuance:
* CSOC Penetration Tests
* CSOC Vulnerability Scans / Discovery Scans
* Security Configuration Compliance Scans
* Secure Code Reviews 
All VA systems were assessed in August 2013 during the deployment of RiskVision. If a package lacked vulnerability information but the security posture was acceptable (according to existing technical testing results, security documentation, etc.), the Authorizing Official can issue an ATO with Conditions thereby allowing the system to store, process, or transmit VA data, while the remaining security information is provided by the System Owner. As new vulnerability scans / technical tests are conducted on systems, they are re-assessed for a new authorization decision based on the current security state. 

The field is required to develop a remediation plan of the vulnerabilities along with an expected completion date, and upload the information to RiskVision. This involves the system personnel analyzing the deficiencies to determine which are applicable to their authorization boundary, identifying false positives, providing a remediation strategy (using various methods), and also providing an expected completion date for remediation. In addition, system personnel have the responsibility of providing updated information and remediation strategies in RiskVision. OIS may follow-up for additional information when necessary. The controls associated with technical scanning are not presented to the facility level but rather the Information System level.

The results of OIS assessments are provided in the T/ATO recommendation that is submitted to the Authorizing Official (AO), the VA Chief Information Officer, for the final authorization decision. OIS provides an explanation of the existing vulnerabilities, the potential risk the vulnerabilities bring to the VA network, as well as conditions that the system needs to address relative to the closure of the vulnerabilities.

Importing Scan Data into RiskVision
RiskVision imports Nessus scan data from CSOC via the Threat & Vulnerability Manager (TVM). Nessus scan data was imported and made available to the field on April 1, 2014.  TVM training was provided to the field on March 26 and 27, 2014.

Reference 2: TVM Training

## 6. NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 to Rev 4 Transition
OIS Risk Based Decision (RBD) 53, Implementation of NIST 800-53 Revision 4 is in place acknowledging that VA has not issued updated policy guidance that adds the new Revision 4 requirements. However, OMB guidance (M-04-14) provides Departments with the flexibility and latitude in applying and implementing NIST's guidelines. VA will apply the NIST Rev 4 guidance to all new system implementations and also when systems undergo upgrades. This is standard practice throughout the government for several years and accepted by OIGs at other Departments. It is not practical or cost effective to immediately update all systems within one year, each time NIST updates its systems security guidelines. The new Revision 4 adds 200 new additional system security controls or enhancements for federal systems. For VA legacy systems in operation and not due for upgrades, VA will consider using RBDs regarding whether it is cost effective to implement out of cycle upgrades to address new NIST systems security guidance.

The updated VA Handbook 6500 reflecting NIST Revision 4 has been drafted and is currently going through the concurrence process, and is expected for release prior to the end of the 2014 fiscal year. OIS is taking action to expedite the policy coordination and issuance process to make it timelier for future policy updates. An RBD or POA&M/Finding will be developed for legacy systems that are not due for upgrades, to assess whether the systems development life cycle process will support the implementation of new, additional controls. 

RiskVision will be capable of performing assessments based on Revision 4 content by June 30, 2014, with new assessments being conducted consistent with Revision 4 by the end of the 1st Quarter of FY15.

 
# Appendix D: Minor Applications Self-Assessment SOP
Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to provide guidelines for the Security Authorization process of Minor Application(s) that are listed under a General Support System (GSS) or Major Application (MA). The SOP establishes procedures for incorporating the Minor Application Security Controls Summary document into the local site's Compliance Report for the parent GSS or Major Application to ensure the security and integrity of the VA's information systems are maintained. In general, a Minor Application is an application that is not a standalone application, or is a component of a MA or GSS, and receives much of its security from the parent application or system. 

The process determines the extent to which the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Each listed control is designed to determine the sufficiency and effectiveness of a controlled feature or safeguard. Not all controls are applicable to all Minor Applications. 

Scope
The scope of the Minor Application Security Controls Summary process covers only the minor application under evaluation, including connectivity within the system. Evaluation will be conducted in the areas of:
 
* Access Control 
* Audit and Accountability 
* Security Authorization and Security Assessments 
* Configuration Management 
* Contingency Planning 
* Identification and Authentication 
* Maintenance 
* Media Protection 
* Physical and Environmental Protection 
* Planning, Personnel Security 
* Risk Assessment 
* System and Services Acquisition 
* System and Communications Protection and 
* System and Information Integrity

Note: Incident Response and Awareness and Training are covered by the GSS or Major Application in their entirety

Procedure
In accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, security categorization for both information and information systems is calculated based on the three basic security objectives; confidentiality, integrity, and availability. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Publication 800-60 Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information System to Security Categories provides implementation guidance in completing this activity. 
* Minor Applications cannot have a Security Category higher than that of the host system.
1. If the application falls under a GSS or Major Application and is considered a Minor Application, then the Minor Application Security Control Summary can be used in place of an SSP. The List of Security Controls of this SOP shall also be used to document the security controls as they are implemented for a specific application. The Minor Application Self-Assessment Workbook can be found at A&A Home Documents. 
2. The ISO, Project Team and the SS, working in conjunction, should prepare the Minor Application Security Control Summary and the List of Security Controls. 
*  Only those controls that are provided by the Minor Application need a complete implementation explanation, annotated and shall be documented just as they would be if an SSP were required. 
*  Controls that are provided by the host system, whether it is a MA or GSS should be annotated as such. 
*  There is no need to annotate common controls, (Those controls are managed at the enterprise level) and they have been eliminated from the list of security controls in order to avoid duplication of effort. 
*  If the control cannot be implemented, it is neither a common control nor a control that is being provided by the host system, it must be noted.
3. The Minor Application Security Control Summary shall be inserted as an appendix to hosting GSS/MA SSP. The application should be identified in the SSP table of content as a Minor Application under GSS or MA.
Monitoring
The ISO will store all records developed throughout this process in the Documents repository within RiskVision of the MA or GSS which supports this Minor Application. Additionally, the ISO conducts audits and/or actions as directed by Continuous Readiness Information Security Program (CRISP) action items and any additional mandated VA policy or guidance.


# Definitions
Authorization: The official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals, based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.
Authorizing Official: Official with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals.
Business Requirements Document (BRD): The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is authored by the business community for the purpose of capturing and describing the business needs of the customer/business owner. The BRD provides insight into the AS IS and TO BE business area, identifying stakeholders and profiling primary and secondary user communities. This document identifies what capabilities the stakeholders and the target users need and why these needs exist, providing a focused overview of the request requirements, constraints, and Information Technology (IT) options to be considered. This document does not state the development methodology.

Common Security Control: Security control that can be applied to one or more agency information systems and has the following properties: (i) the development, implementation, and assessment of the control can be assigned to a responsible official or organizational element (other than the information system owner); and (ii) the results from the assessment of the control can be used to support the security certification and authorization processes of an agency information system where that control has been applied.

Compensating Security Controls: The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) employed by an organization in lieu of the recommended controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in NIST SP 800-53, Latest Version, that provide equivalent or comparable protection for information systems and the information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.

EIB Milestone 0: Enterprise Information Board (EIB0 Milestone 0 is intended to have the Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer Representative, or Project Manager address the basic areas necessary to warrant project initiation approval. It does not presume any significant prior investment in analysis (either business or technical), concept or requirements definition or design; rather, it seeks answers to these most basic questions even before committing to that level of investment. The Project Manager should have a clear understanding of the problem that needs to be solved and how solving that problem supports a strategic objective of the Department. Based on a successful Milestone 0 review, the Project Manager will be authorized to expend the resources necessary to establish the project's business case and prepare for the project's Milestone I review.

General Support System: An interconnected set of information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. It normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and people.

High Impact System: An information system in which a least one security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS 199 potential impact value of high.

Information Owner: Official with statutory or operational authority for specified information and responsibility for establishing the controls for its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal.

Information Security: A means for protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

Information Security Officer (ISO): Individual responsible to the senior agency information security officer, authorizing official, or information system owner for ensuring the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or program.

Information Security Requirements: Information security requirements promulgated in accordance with law, or directed by the Secretary of VA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Office of Management and Budget, and, as to national security systems, the President.

Information Sensitivity: Information sensitivity reflects the relationship between the characteristics of the information processed (e.g., personnel data subject to protection under the Privacy Act) and the mission need to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information (e.g., legal requirements to protect confidentiality of personal data). Sensitivity may vary from low, to medium, to high.
Information System Owner: Official responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system.

Information Type: A specific category of information, (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security management), defined by an organization, or in some instances, by a specific law, executive order, directive, policy or regulation.

Low Impact System: An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e. confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS 199 potential impact value of low.

Major Application: An application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application.

Minor Application: An application can be classified as being a Minor Application if they meet the following conditions: they rely upon a General Support System (GSS) or Major Application for security, they are within another system's authorization boundary, and they do not have their own capital plan.

Moderate Impact System: An information system in which at least one security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS 199 potential impact value of moderate and no security objective is assigned a FIPS 199 potential impact value of high.

Potential Impact: The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have: (i) a limited adverse effect (FIPS 199 low); (ii) a serious adverse effect (FIPS 199 moderate); or (iii) a severe or catastrophic adverse effect (FIPS 199 high) on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

Security Category: The characterization of information or an information system based on an assessment of the potential impact that a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information or information system would have on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

Security Controls: The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information.

System Security Plan: Formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for the information system and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
