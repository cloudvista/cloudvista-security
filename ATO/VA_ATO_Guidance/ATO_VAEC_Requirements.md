### Appendix A – FedRAMP/Cloud – VA Requirements 

FedRAMP Authorized Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Reciprocity (Agency ATO) Process

Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is designed to assist agencies in meeting FISMA requirements for cloud systems.  CSPs must meet FedRAMP in order to do business with US government agencies as part of the “Cloud first policy”.  FedRAMP is designed as a “do once, use many” framework to create efficiency in government procurement of cloud services.  As part of the program, CSPs pursuing FedRAMP are required to be independently assessed by a Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO).  Per the “Acceptance of FEDRAMP Authorization Memo” issued on August 11, 2015 by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Security, “existing Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorizations for certified FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider cloud systems should be evaluated, and reused when possible, to reduce the overall time required to grant an authorization and begin using a cloud service.”.

The Cloud/FedRAMP Reciprocity ATO process consists of the following steps:

Note: A contract must be in place before requesting a RiskVision entry of the FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider. In the absence of a contract, RVWG will not entertain any such request.  

1.	Designate an ISO and System Owner to the project.

2.	Coordinate with the RVWG to request a RiskVision entry of the FedRAMP Cloud Service Provider.  Reference section 2 (Authorization Prerequisites) for action steps.

3.	System Owner and ISO will complete the CSP system questionnaire within RiskVision to define the system acronym, security categorization, operational status, system type, cloud computing service model [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), etc.], and cloud service type (private, public, hybrid).

4.	ISO will request FedRAMP repository access for CSP authorization documentation package by completing the FedRAMP Agency Access Request Form and emailing to Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) at vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov.

5.	ISO will map the CSP authorization documentation artifacts to the VA ATO documentation requirements in RiskVision.  Then review and assess the CSP’s 3PAO FedRAMP authorized SSP using the NIST/CAG-20 scoresheet provided by OIS.  All documents will be uploaded to the Documents tab in RiskVision.

6.	CSP authorization package in RiskVision will then be advanced to OIS and Certification Authority (CA) for review.  Additionally, VA determines if the CSP system appropriately addresses any and all necessary VA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) requirements (e.g., all external systems, including cloud solutions, hosted from facilities or data centers outside of the VA network and boundary must comply with DHS TIC requirements and VA’s external connection agreements) before progressing to the VA CISO and Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) for agency ATO consideration. 


### Cloud-Based VA Application / Third-Party System ATO Process

The Cloud/FedRAMP cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System ATO process consists of the following steps:

1.	Coordinate with the RVWG to request a RiskVision entry of the cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System.  Reference section 2 (Authorization Prerequisites) for action steps.

2.	System Owner and ISO will complete the CSP/VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System questionnaire within RiskVision to define the system acronym, security categorization, operational status, system type, etc.

3.	Customer Responsibilities Security Plan provided by the CSP ISO will be completed by the System Owner.  This set of security controls is documented in the FedRAMP authorized CSP Customer Responsibilities Matrix.  The security plan controls have been mapped to VA 6500 requirements.  

4.	ISO will review the completed Customer Responsibilities Security Plan for proper implementation details and uploads to the Documents tab in RiskVision.
The cloud-based VA Application / Workload / Third-Party System in RiskVision will then be advanced to OIS and Certification Authority (CA) for review before progressing to the VA CISO and Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) for agency ATO consideration.
