## SUMMARY
AbleVets team had uploaded all required documents including the POAMs for final ATO submission before the freeze of RV on July 14, 2019.

Our team had to wait for 3-week for eMASS training and RV to eMASS transition from July 14, 2019 to July 29, 2019, then Aug 3rd Security Lead regaining access to EMASS. Configuration of VAM to EMASS Aug 9th. 

During the eMASS training, we learned of the new ATO package approval process in eMASS. We determined that unlike RiskVision, eMASS requires at least twice as many steps (See Image) in the approval process, which in-effect, incurs more dependency on VA availability. In other words, there is a greater chance of delay due to being dependent upon others and their schedules (PTO, training, common work etc.) in getting approvals to receive an ATO in eMASS compared to RiskVision. Additionally,  we learned that the entire VA network staff related to eMASS is also learning this new system, thus creating further delay. Moreover,  given the number of systems transitioning from RiskVision to eMASS, the current staff required in the approval process of an ATO is limited. 

During the training we determined that the estimated time it takes for an ATO process in eMASS, from start to finish, is about 9 months at the least.  Now, this is based on a system just starting out, but for us and factoring everything we stated above, we estimated that our process till ATO approval is at least 3-4 months, if not more. 

So, this prompted us to dig further into figuring out a way to avoid this new delay, which resulted in us understanding the process of a conditional 1-year ATO. And decided to get the SO, ISO, VA PM, and BO to accept the 1-year ATO instead, which was initially considered a conditional ATO of 30 or 120 days, but it is now a single year conditional ATO. 
The 1-year ATO are typically for projects which need to address specific concerns at a faster rate (Escalated) for whatever reason, and our reason is sufficient, since the eMASS migration could and likely hinder our ability to complete an ATO in time before IOC and/or possibly the contract end date. 

The 1-year conditional ATO will essentially shotgun through the normal approval process and save us roughly 3-4 months at the minimum. However, the VA can still disapprove our ATO, but given the work done in RV and the amount of counseling that we have had from our ISO, we see no reason why that will happen, because we will have everything needed for a conditional approval from the Authorizing Official (AO) in eMASS. Even with a denial, we will still be able to resubmit for the 1-year conditional ATO and make better time than the normal ATO process.
